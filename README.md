# C-prog

A collection of C programs I have written as part of school assignments and labs.

## Overview

- `compute_pi`: Approximating the value of PI using the trapezoidal rule, Monte Carlo method, and the Leibniz formula.

- `str_manipulation`: Converting between string and integer, and concatenation of two strings.

- `to_roman_numeral`: Converting integers to its Roman numeral equivalent.

- `vector_operations`: Vector (represented as array) operations: reversing elements, scalar multiplication, cross product, dot product calculation.

## To run

Use the makefile in each project.

- `make`: Compiles the project (use `./main` after compiling to run).

- `make run`: Compile & runs the project.

- `make clean`: Cleanup executables and output files.
